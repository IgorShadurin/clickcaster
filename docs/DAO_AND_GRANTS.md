# DAO & Grants System

## Introduction

The primary objective of this initiative is to encourage the development of more innovative and high-quality applications within the Web3 ecosystem. By leveraging a traffic exchange system operated as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), we aim to stimulate growth and innovation in a self-sustaining manner.

## Transition from Centralized to Decentralized

### Initial Phase: Centralized Service
- The system initiates as a centralized entity to ensure rapid deployment and immediate impact on the ecosystem.
- A phased approach will gradually decentralize the system, transitioning key components to autonomous operations.

### Decentralization Goals
- Decentralization involves distributing control and decision-making across the network, reducing reliance on any single point of failure or authority.
- Essential components of the traffic exchange system will undergo decentralization to enhance security, transparency, and participation.

## Sustainability and Fee Structure

### Traffic as a Resource
- Accumulated traffic within the system serves as a primary asset, facilitating both sustainability and the achievement of the system's goals.
- A portion of the traffic is allocated for grants to support Web3 developers in user acquisition efforts.
- Remaining traffic may be sold to cover operational expenses, ensuring the project's long-term viability.

## Grant Distribution Process

### Initial Committee Formation
- The grant committee begins as a Warpcast group consisting of system participants, allowing for immediate and inclusive decision-making.
- Voting power is directly proportional to the amount of traffic contributed by a participant during the voting period.

### Application and Voting
- Web3 developers can propose their applications for grant consideration via the group.
- Support for a proposal is indicated by positive comments from participants, while opposition is expressed through negative comments.

## Toward Full Autonomy

### Automated Operations
- With the achievement of full sustainability, the grant distribution process and other operational aspects of the system can be automated.
- Specific roles will be designated for individuals to oversee various components, ensuring the system's integrity and efficiency.

### Decentralized Components
- Ongoing development efforts will focus on decentralizing system components to prevent traffic manipulation and foster a trustless environment.
- This includes smart contracts for transparent voting and allocation of grants, decentralized storage for application proposals, and blockchain-based tracking of traffic contributions.
